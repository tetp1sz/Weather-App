# 🌤️ **GUI Weather App** 🌤️

###### ℹ️ This program is written in _python_ and is designed to view the weather in different locations. The program is based on the _openweathermap site API_ and the _requests_ and _customtkinter_ modules for python. Also, the program uses an exception handler to determine the existence of the city entered by the user.
